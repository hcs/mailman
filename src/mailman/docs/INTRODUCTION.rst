Mailman - The GNU Mailing List Management System
================================================

This is `GNU Mailman`_, a mailing list management system distributed under the
terms of the `GNU General Public License`_ (GPL) version 3 or later.

Mailman is written in Python_, a free object-oriented programming language.
Python is available for all platforms that Mailman is supported on, which
includes GNU/Linux and most other Unix-like operating systems (e.g. Solaris,
\*BSD, MacOSX, etc.).  Mailman is not supported on Windows, although web and
mail clients on any platform should be able to interact with Mailman just
fine.

History
=======

Mailman was originally developed by John Viega.  Subsequent development
(through version 1.0b3) was by Ken Manheimer.  Further work towards the 1.0
final release was a group effort, with the core contributors being: Barry
Warsaw, Ken Manheimer, Scott Cotton, Harald Meland, and John Viega.  Version
1.0 and beyond have been primarily maintained by Barry Warsaw with
contributions from many; see the ACKNOWLEDGMENTS file for details.  Jeremy
Hylton helped considerably with the Pipermail code in Mailman 2.0.  Mailman
2.1 is primarily maintained by Mark Sapiro, with previous help by Tokio
Kikuchi.  Barry Warsaw is the lead developer on Mailman 3.

"""Mailman test layers."""

# XXX 2012-03-23 BAW: Layers really really suck.  For example, the
# test_owners_get_email() test requires that both the SMTPLayer and LMTPLayer
# be set up, but there's apparently no way to do that and make zope.testing
# happy.  This causes no tests failures, but it does cause errors at the end
# of the full test run.  For now, I'll ignore that, but I do want to
# eventually get rid of the zope.test* dependencies and use something like
# testresources or some such.
